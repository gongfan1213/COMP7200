# Academic Integrity

• “The University staunchly upholds the principles of academic integrity. As one part of HKBU’s effort to prevent plagiarism, the software Turnitin is used to compare all assignments against multiple sources whenever appropriate.”

• “A report on each assignment is generated that includes a percentage similarity and links to specific similar sources.”

• “Turnitin does not conclusively prove whether or not an assignment is plagiarized – the faculty will make this determination.”

• We will also check your assignments/report against the contents generated by Chat-GPT or other AIGC-tools.
