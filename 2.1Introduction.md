**Non-Fungible Token (NFT)**

- NFT is a unit of data stored on blockchain to represent the ownership of an object (a virtual asset).
- Each NFT represents something unique, not interchangeable, and not divisible.
- Can be photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files.
- Platforms and Standards
  - Ethereum
    - ERC-721
    - ERC-1155

**NFT**

- NFTs are unique and non-interchangeable assets (data) stored on blockchains.
- Fungibility – the ability of an asset to be exchanged or substituted with similar assets of the same value.
- The lack of interchangeability (fungibility) distinguishes NFTs from blockchain cryptocurrencies.

**Outline**

**Blockchain - A High-level View**

- Cryptocurrency != Blockchain
- Blockchain: a kind of data structure
- A blockchain consists of a number of consecutively-connected blocks.
- Each block points to its immediately-previous block (called parent block) via an inverse reference that is essentially the hash value of the parent block.
- the hash value of the root of a Merkel tree with concatenating the hash values of all the transactions in the block

**Blockchain**

- Bitcoin Genesis Block
  - "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"

**Blockchain - A High-level View**

- Blockchain System: a decentralized system
- The construction of a blockchain system requires diverse ICT technologies:
  - Cryptographic algorithms
  - Computer networks
  - Distributed systems and consensus
  - Smart contracts (software technology)
  - Reward and transaction cost (economics)

**Working flow of blockchain**

- Consider a single transaction

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85737cf4-2beb-4a28-b188-ece062fb472d)



**Blockchain Transactions**

- Smallest element
- Record every decision and action taken
- Proof of history, provides provenance

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fce37d9-1b71-4105-abde-af1c780b026e)


**Blockchain “Block”**

- Contain multiple transactions
- The transaction is immutable/indelible
- Write and Read-Only
- Once a block is chained, it is extremely difficult to change
- Modification possible
- Rework on all the subsequent blocks and consensus for each block

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c502298d-275b-4044-bd15-5a9414e59b39)


**Chain of Blocks**

- Contain multiple blocks
- Blocks linked using cryptography
- An instance of distributed ledger

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e58b6dc5-069e-4634-ac99-6f4d38d733e2)


**Distributed Network**

- Blockchain operates on a decentralized/distributed P2P network
- Each node stores a copy of the ledger

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9795c659-3f73-47c8-9958-34c6dece7352)


**Distributed Ledger**

- Blockchain is a distributed ledger
- Centralized ledger: stored by a central node
- Distributed ledger: stored in every node
- All nodes agree on the true state of the ledger (via a consensus protocol)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f09e7dd3-3636-40ae-b4d6-583487e5454f)


**Distributed Ledger**

- Keep track of all transactions performed in the network
- Can be encrypted for confidentiality
- Can be used without by individuals without a central authority
- Immutable: Ledger records are very difficult to be altered
- Changing a record in the ledger requires a consensus from all participants
- Rework on all subsequent records

**Demo of blockchain**

- [https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/)

**Distributed Consensus**

- Ensure the blocks in blockchain are valid and truthful
- Prevent malicious adversaries from system compromise and chain forking
- Many consensus protocols, each with different pros and cons
  - Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), Proof of Activity (PoA), Proof of Burn (PoB)
  - Paxos, BFT, Streamlet
- We will explore many of blockchain consensus protocols later

**Smart Contract**

- A program running in a secure environment that controls the transfer of digital assets between parties under certain conditions
- Contract encoded into blockchain
- Enable broader blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrencies

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.5.8;

contract SimpleBank {
    mapping(address => uint) balances;

    function deposit(uint amount) payable public {
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

**Smart Contract**

- Smart contract is a computer program that
  - Defines rules
  - Enforces obligations and penalties
  - Executes actions required by clauses
  - Autonomous without ownership
  - Secure
- Written in a high-level programming language (e.g., Solidity)

**Blockchain Techniques Smart Contracts? Language**

- Bitcoin ✗ C++
- Ethereum ✓ Solidity
- Hyperledger ✓ GoLang, C++, etc

**Merits of smart contract**

- Reducing risks. Due to the immutability, traceability and auditability of blockchain data.
- Cutting down administration and service costs. Blockchains assure the trust without going through a central broker or a mediator. Smart contracts can be automatically triggered in a decentralized way.
- Improving the efficiency of business processes. The elimination of the dependence on the intermediary can significantly improve the efficiency of business process.

**Blockchain in Medical records**

- You enter a health facility (not your home facility)
- You provide proof of identity verified with a blockchain
- Your “private key” unlocks encrypted data related only your health records
- Also provides a much stronger privacy protection
  - Instead of a medical database being encrypted with one key (which might be lost or discovered), each patient’s record has its own key. Hence, to compromise the database you would need to guess potentially millions of keys

**Blockchain in Medical Prescriptions**

- Widespread fraud
  - Blank scripts are stolen from doctors’ offices or forged
  - Some doctors abuse the system
- Token issued to patient: it cannot be resold and has an expiration
- Patient presents token to pharmacist and blockchain is checked to make sure patient owns the token (and has not already spent it)

**Internet of Medical Things**

- IoMT communications
- Sensor/IoT device
- Base station IoT Gateway
- Wireless link
- Data management
- Computing facilities
- IoMT data
