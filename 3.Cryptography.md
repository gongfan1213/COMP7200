**Cryptography**

**Outline**

- Introduction to Cryptography
- Classical ciphers
- Computer Cryptography

**Cryptography ≠ Security**

- Cryptography may be a component of a secure system.
- Adding cryptography may not make a system secure.

**Terms**

- Plaintext (cleartext) is denoted by message M.
- Encryption is denoted by function E(M).
- It then produces ciphertext denoted by C=E(M).
- Decryption of the ciphertext and obtain original message M=D(C).
- Cipher: Cryptographic algorithm.

**Terms: types of ciphers**

- Restricted cipher
- Symmetric algorithms
- Public key algorithms

**Restricted cipher**

- Secret algorithm
- Leaking
- Reverse engineering
- HD DVD (Dec 2006) and Blu-Ray (Jan 2007)
- RC4
- All digital cellular encryption algorithms
- DVD and DIVX video compression
- Firewire
- Enigma cipher machine
- Every NATO and Warsaw Pact algorithm during Cold War

**The key**

*BTW, the above is a bump key. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_bumping.*

**The key**

*Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_tumbler_lock*

**The key**

*Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_tumbler_lock*

**The key**

- We understand how it works:
  - Strengths
  - Weaknesses
- Based on this understanding, we can assess how much to trust the key & lock.

**Symmetric algorithm**

- Secret key
- C = EK(M)
- M = DK(C)

**Public key algorithm**

- Public key and private keys
- C1 = Epublic(M)
- M = Dprivate(C1)
- also:
- C2 = Eprivate(M)
- M = Dpublic(C2)

**McCarthy’s puzzle (1958)**

- Two countries are at war.
- One country sends spies to the other country.
- To return safely, spies must give the border guards a password.
- Spies can be trusted.
- Guards chat – information given to them may leak.

**Challenge!**

How can a guard authenticate a person without knowing the password? Enemies cannot use the guard’s knowledge to introduce their own spies.

**Solution to McCarthy’s puzzle**

Michael Rabin, 1958

Use one-way function, B=f(A)

- Guards get B …
- Enemy cannot compute A
- Spies give A, guards compute f(A)
- If the result is B, the password is correct.

**Example function:**

Middle squares

- Take a 100-digit number (A), and square it
- Let B = middle 100 digits of 200-digit result

**McCarthy’s puzzle example**

Example with an 18-digit number

A = 289407349786637777

A² = 83756614110525308948445338203501729

Middle square, B = 110525308948445338

Given A, it is easy to compute B.

Given B, it is extremely hard to compute A.

**One-way functions**

- Easy to compute in one direction.
- Difficult to compute in the other.

**Examples:**

Factoring:

- pq = N (EASY)
- find p,q given N (DIFFICULT)

Discrete Log:

- ab mod c = N (EASY)
- find b given a, c, N (DIFFICULT)

**More terms**

- one-way function
- Rabin, 1958: McCarthy’s problem
- middle squares, exponentiation, …
- [one-way] hash function
- message digest, fingerprint, cryptographic checksum, integrity check
- encrypted hash
- message authentication code
- only possessor of key can validate message

**More terms**

- Stream cipher
  - Encrypt a message a character at a time.
- Block cipher
  - Encrypt a message a chunk at a time.
- Digital Signature
  - Authenticate, not encrypt message
  - Use pair of keys (private, public)
  - Owner encrypts message with private key
  - Sender validates by decrypting with public key
  - Generally use hash(message).

**Outline**

- Introduction to Cryptography
- Classical ciphers
- Computer Cryptography

**Cryptography: what is it good for?**

- Authentication
  - determine origin of message
- Integrity
  - verify that message has not been modified
- Nonrepudiation
  - sender should not be able to falsely deny that a message was sent
- Confidentiality
  - others cannot read contents of the message

**Cæsar cipher**

Earliest documented military use of cryptography

- Julius Caesar c. 60 BC
- shift cipher: simple variant of a substitution cipher
- each letter replaced by one n positions away modulo alphabet size
- n = shift value = key
- Similar scheme used in India
- early Indians also used substitutions based on phonetics similar to pig latin
- Last seen as ROT13 on usenet to keep the reader from seeing offensive messages unwillingly

**Substitution cipher**

- General case: arbitrary mapping
- both sides must have substitution alphabet

**Substitution cipher**

Easy to decode:

- vulnerable to frequency analysis

- At least 12 characters long but 14 or more is better.
- A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

**Outline**

- Introduction to Cryptography
- Classical ciphers
- Computer Cryptography

**DES**

- Data Encryption Standard
- adopted as a federal standard in 1976
- block cipher, 64-bit blocks
- 56-bit key
- all security rests with the key
- substitution followed by a permutation (transposition)
- same combination of techniques is applied on the plaintext block 16 times

**DES**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2058aaf-baf6-4c33-9a38-c7003e0403f5)





64-bit plaintext block

initial permutation, IP

left half, L0 right half, R0

f

R1 = L0 ⊕ f(R0, K1) L1= R0

K1

16 rounds

L15= R14 R15 = L14 ⊕ f(R14, K15)

48-bit subkey permuted from key

**DES: S-boxes**

- After compressed key is XORed with expanded block
- 48-bit result moves to substitution operation via 8 substitution boxes (s-boxes)
- Each S-box has
  - 6-bit input
  - 4-bit output
- 48 bits divided into eight 6-bit sub-blocks
- Each block is operated by a separate S-box
- key components of DES’s security
- net result: 48-bit input generates 32-bit output

**Is DES secure?**

56-bit key makes DES relatively weak

- 7.2×10¹⁶ keys
- Brute-force attack

Late 1990’s:

- DES cracker machines built to crack DES keys in a few hours
- DES Deep Crack: 90 billion keys/second
- Distributed.net: test 250 billion keys/second

**The power of 2**

Adding an extra bit to a key doubles the search space.

Suppose it takes 1 second to attack a 20-bit key:

- 21-bit key: 2 seconds
- 32-bit key: 1 hour
- 40-bit key: 12 days
- 56-bit key: 2,178 years
- 64-bit key: >557,000 years!

**Increasing The Key**

Can double encryption work for DES?

- Useless if we could find a key K such that:

EK(P) = EK₂(EK₁(P))

- This does not hold for DES

**Double DES**

Vulnerable to meet-in-the-middle attack

If we know some pair (P, C), then:

- [1] Encrypt P for all 2⁵⁶ values of K₁
- [2] Decrypt C for all 2⁵⁶ values of K₂

For each match where [1] = [2]

- test the two keys against another P, C pair
- if match, you are assured that you have the key

**Triple DES**

Triple DES with two 56-bit keys:

C = EK₁(DK₂(EK₁(P)))

Triple DES with three 56-bit keys:

C = EK₃(DK₂(EK₁(P)))

Decryption used in middle step for compatibility with DES (K₁=K₂=K₃=k)

C = EK(DK(EK(P))) ≡ C = EK₁(P)

**Triple DES**

Prevent meet-in-the-middle attack with

- three stages
- and two keys

Triple DES:

C = EK₁(DK₂(EK₁(P)))

Decryption used in middle step for compatibility with DES

C = EK(DK(EK(P))) ≡ C = EK₁(P)

**Popular symmetric algorithms**

IDEA - International Data Encryption Algorithm

- 1992
- 128-bit keys, operates on 8-byte blocks (like DES)
- algorithm is more secure than DES

RC4, by Ron Rivest

- 1995
- key size up to 2048 bits
- not secure against multiple messages encrypted with the same key

AES - Advanced Encryption Standard

- NIST proposed successor to DES, chosen in October 2000
- based on Rijndael cipher
- 128, 192, and 256-bit keys

**AES**

From NIST:

Assuming that one could build a machine that could recover a DES key in a second (i.e., try 2⁵⁶ keys per second), then it would take that machine approximately 149 trillion years to crack a 128-bit AES key. To put that into perspective, the universe is believed to be less than 20 billion years old.

**Symmetric cryptography**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6e5b053-4b3d-4415-a1aa-3eb4479d3b44)


- Both parties must agree on a secret key, K
- message is encrypted, sent, decrypted at other side
- Key distribution must be secret
  - otherwise messages can be decrypted
  - users can be impersonated

**Key explosion**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/078407c8-1d44-4601-ad8b-a360cc9499fb)


Each pair of users needs a separate key for secure communication

- 2 users: 1 key
- 3 users: 3 keys
- 4 users: 6 keys
- 6 users: 15 keys
- 100 users: 4950 keys
- 1000 users: 399500 keys
- n users: (n² - n)/2 keys

**Key distribution**

Secure key distribution is the biggest problem with symmetric cryptography

How can you communicate securely with someone you’ve never met?

Whit Diffie: idea for a public key algorithm

Challenge: can this be done securely?

Knowledge of public key should not allow derivation of private key

**Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange**

Key distribution algorithm

- first algorithm to use public/private keys
- not public key encryption
- based on difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in a finite field compared with ease of calculating exponentiation

Allows us to negotiate a secret session key without fear of eavesdroppers

**Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange**

- All arithmetic performed in field of integers modulo some large number
- Both parties agree on
  - a large prime number p
  - and a number α < p
- Each party generates a public/private key pair
  - private key for user i: Xi
  - public key for user i: Yi

**Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange**

- Alice has secret key XA
- Alice has public key YA
- Alice computes

- Bob has secret key XB
- Bob has public key YB

**Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange**

- Alice has secret key XA
- Alice has public key YA
- Alice computes

- Bob has secret key XB
- Bob has public key YB
- Bob computes

K' = (Alice’s public key) (Bob’s private key) mod p

**Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange**

- Alice has secret key XA
- Alice has public key YA
- Alice computes

- Bob has secret key XB
- Bob has public key YB
- Bob computes

K is a common key, known only to Bob and Alice

K = K'

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04279f59-6c54-4fb1-9514-b04b86c52e03)


Alice picks

XA = 18

Alice’s public key is:

YA = 7¹⁸ mod 31667 = 6780

K = 22184¹⁸ mod 31667

K = 14265

Bob picks

XB = 27

Bob’s public key is:

YB = 7²⁷ mod 31667 = 22184

K = 6780²⁷ mod 31667

K = 14265

Suppose p = 31667, α = 7

**Key distribution problem is solved!**

- User maintains private key
- Publishes public key in database (“phonebook”)
- Communication begins with key exchange to establish a common key
- Common key can be used to encrypt a session key
- increase difficulty of breaking common key by reducing the amount of data we encrypt with it
- session key is valid only for one communication session

**RSA: Public Key Cryptography**

- Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, Leonard Adleman created a true public key encryption algorithm in 1977
- Each user generates two keys
  - private key (kept secret)
  - public key
- Difficulty of algorithm based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers
- keys are functions of a pair of large (~200 digits) prime numbers

**RSA algorithm**

Generate keys:

- choose two random large prime numbers p, q
- Compute the product n = pq
- randomly choose the encryption key, e, such that:

e and (p - 1)(q - 1) are relatively prime

- use the extended Euclidean algorithm to compute the decryption key, d:

ed = 1 mod ((p - 1) (q - 1))

d = e⁻¹ mod ((p - 1) (q - 1))

- discard p, q

**RSA algorithm**

Encrypt:

- divide data into numerical blocks < n
- encrypt each block:

c = mᵉ mod n

Decrypt:

m = cᵈ mod n

**Communication with public key algorithms**

Different keys for encrypting and decrypting

- no need to worry about key distribution

**Public key woes**

Public key cryptography is great but:

- RSA about 100 times slower than DES in software, 1000 times slower in HW
- Vulnerable to chosen plaintext attack
  - if you know the data is one of n messages, just encrypt each message with the recipient’s public key and compare
- It’s a good idea to reduce the amount of data encrypted with any given key
  - but generating RSA keys is computationally very time consuming

**Signatures**

*Source: http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration.html*

We use signatures because a signature is

- Authentic
- Unforgeable
- Not reusable
- Non-repudiable
- Renders document unalterable

**Signatures**

We use signatures because a signature is

- Authentic
- Unforgeable
- Not reusable
- Non-repudiable
- Renders document unalterable

**Digital signatures - arbitrated protocol**

Arbitrated protocol using symmetric encryption

- turn to trusted third party (arbiter) to authenticate messages

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e65773f8-10e4-47c5-b2dc-97bf0aab4792)


**Arbitrated protocol**

Alice Bob

Trent

C=EA(P)

Alice encrypts message for herself and sends it to Trent

Trent is trusted

and has everyone’s keys

**Arbitrated protocol**

Alice Bob

Trent

P= DA(C)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/754d7c28-8691-4f2f-8384-b420638a6fb7)



Trent receives Alice’s message and decrypts it with Alice’s key

- this authenticates that it came from Alice

- he may choose to log a hash of the message to create a record of the transmission

**Arbitrated protocol**

Alice Bob

Trent

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3d0b009-69a8-46be-ab5d-e321cd70eb30)


Trent now encrypts the message for Bob and sends it to Bob

C’= EB(P)

Alice Bob

Trent

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/848973b0-2d54-483f-a2e7-c146d590eaaf)


Bob receives the message and decrypts it

- it must have come from Trent since only Trent and Bob have Bob’s key

- if the message says it’s from Alice, it must be - we trust Trent

P’= DB(C’)

**Digital signatures - public key cryptography**

Ea(P)

DA(C)

Alice Bob

encrypt message with Alice’s private key

decrypt message with Alice’s public key

Encrypting a message with a private key is the same as signing!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1a204ca-1e0c-483a-9cda-b8aae0941511)


**Digital signatures - public key cryptography**



- What if Alice was sending Bob binary data?

- Bob might have a hard time knowing whether the decryption was successful or not

- Public key encryption is considerably slower than symmetric encryption

  - what if the message is very large?

- What if we don’t want to hide the message, yet want a valid signature?

**Digital signatures - public key cryptography**

- Create a hash of the message

- Encrypt the hash and send it with the message

- Validate the hash by decrypting it and comparing it with the hash of the received message

- The signature is now a distinct entity from the message

**Digital signatures - public key cryptography**
